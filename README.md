Module 14 Javascript assignment
This URL site displays the number of bacteria present found in some people within a particular sample size.
The site displays the demographics of the subject, top 10 bacteria found in his belly button, and how frequent he
washes his belly button in a week.

the lesser is the number of bacteria found.
